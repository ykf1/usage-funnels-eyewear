# usage-funnels-eyewear

This is a codecademy project using SQL to analyse usage funnels for a designer eyewear company based on fictional data.

The data provided are namely: 'survey', 'quiz', 'home_try_on' and 'purchase'. I have attached the code used in this project and the output results in an Excel file in this repository.

The designer eyewear company has a Style Quiz that has the following questions:
1. What are you looking for?
2. What’s your fit?
3. Which shapes do you like?
4. Which colors do you like?
5. When was your last eye exam?
The users’ responses are stored in the table 'survey'.
